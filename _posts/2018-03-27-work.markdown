I finally thought I should post something here. Not sure why. I kinda just need to say something. Especially when there is nobody to talk to, it's better to write something so others can actually read that when they have nothing else to do.

I hate work. Nobody likes work, but I hate with passion. Ok, maybe I said it wrong. I hate being forced to work. Especially to work on something I don't care about. I know it's normal there are people above us. But that's worse when there are too many of them. The ones, that stand above us and tell us what to do.

OK, I don't hate working. I love working on stuff. I hate work they give me. It makes me feel empty. It makes me feel like I have nothing else to do in life. It makes me feel there is nothing better that can happen to me in my life. I know that's not true. I believe everybody can do whatever they want when they want to.

But some people... Some people don't understand it. And never will.

See ya all.

Ps. I know this doesn't make sense. Don't cry because of that.
